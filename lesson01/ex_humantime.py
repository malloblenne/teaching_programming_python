# My geek friend expresses the time for our appointment only using international measurement units
# He therefore tells me, 'Let's meet in 830000 seconds'
# Write a program that given a time expressed in seconds written via console input from the user it translates it in day,hour,minutes,seconds

# Example output:
# My friend wants to meet me in seconds: 10204304050505
# It corresponds to X days, Y hours, Z minutes, K seconds
